Review the current changes in the working tree or the specified files.

1. Identify what was changed and categorize each change
   (new code, modification, deletion).
2. Check for: scope creep beyond the intended task, inconsistency
   with existing codebase patterns, untyped or loosely typed code,
   disabled lint rules, hardcoded values, placeholder implementations.
3. Surface any issues found. For each issue state: what it is,
   where it is, and why it is a concern.
4. Do not make changes. This is analysis only.
