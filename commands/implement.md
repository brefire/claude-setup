Implement the following functional change. Before writing any code:

1. Restate the task: what will change, what files are in scope,
   what is out of scope.
2. Wait for my confirmation before proceeding.
3. Make only the changes required. Do not refactor adjacent code.
4. On completion, provide a PR-ready summary of all changes.
