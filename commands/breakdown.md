I need to break down the following work into executable tasks.
Do not implement anything. This is planning only.

For the work described below:

1. ANALYZE the codebase to understand the current architecture,
   patterns, and relevant files.

2. IDENTIFY the functional changes required. Each task must be:
   - A single functional change (one intent, one output).
   - Scoped to a specific location in the codebase.
   - Small enough to complete and verify in a single pass.
   - Independent or with clearly stated dependencies on other tasks.

3. For each task, provide:
   - TASK: A clear one-line description of the functional change.
   - INTENT: What should be different when this task is done.
   - LOCATION: What files/components are likely in scope.
   - DEPENDS ON: Which other tasks must be completed first (if any).
   - ACCEPTANCE: How to verify this task is complete (observable output).

4. ORDER the tasks by dependency, then by logical sequence.

5. FLAG any areas where you lack enough information to define
   a task. State what decisions I need to make before that task
   can be scoped.

Do not begin work on any task. Present the breakdown and wait
for my review.
